# PHM2D-Idle
A batch file for Idle Master Extended.

## Why?
This batch file can help you idle up to 20 games with Idle Master Extended **without running the program itself**.

The batch file somehow simulates the *"Fast Mode"* from Idle Master Extended in a way that once you start using it, the batch file would close your games after *5 minutes* and opens them again with a delay of *5 seconds*.

***The idea*** is to not insert your steam account information inside Idle Master Extended and use it directly just by inserting game's ids.

## How to Use:
Download **"[Idle Master Extended](https://github.com/JonasNilson/idle_master_extended)"**.

Sign in to your **"Steam"** account.

Download ***"PHM2D Idle"*** and put it inside **"Idle Master Extended"** directory that contains **"IdleMasterExtended.exe"** and extract it *(Extract Here)*.

Run ***"PHM2D Idle.exe"***.

Run ***"PHM2D Idle 1.0.bat"*** or ***"PHM2D Idle Lite 1.0.bat"***. You can also run them with shortcuts from your dekstop.

Choose the number of games that you want to idle (You can choose up to *20 games* for the **basic** version & up to *9 games* for the **lite** version).

Confirm your number.

Insert the codes and press enter after each one.

The idling would start and continue until you close the CMD.

## How to Change Idle Time:

Right click on the batch file and select **"Edit"**.

Search this up: *(300 -1 0)* and then change 300 to any number of *seconds unit* that you desire (e.g., 300 seconds = 5 minutes).

## Version 1.1:
- Combined both *"Basic"* and *"Lite"* into one file.
- Idle up to *30 games*.
- Fixed some bugs.

## Version 1.2:
- Idle up to *500 games*.
- Lighter code and faster interface.
